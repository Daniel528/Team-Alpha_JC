## Team
#### Jacqueline
Jacqueline is in her last semester, doing master degree of Interaction Design. In this project, she researched on how to magnify impacts of data visualization on energy saving behaviour, prepared for paper prototype and conducted user testing with Carmen, worked on part of high-fidelity prototype in Unity, designed poster and brochure for final showcase.

#### Carmen
Carmen is also the last semester and her major is the interaction desin. In this project, she did the initial research about the form of presenting the data and also did the paper research on the information which can motivate users to reduce energy waste. She conducted user testing with Jacqueline and also work on part of high fidelity prototype.
